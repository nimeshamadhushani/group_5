             A historical city located in Southwestern Sri Lanka is an Asian tourist haven today and many are flocking from around the world to this beautiful place! A stunning fort, Dutch colonial architecture and beaches; there is no shortage of places to visit in Galle and around. It’s difficult to know who to credit with the architectural achievement of Galle. The Portuguese built this fortified coastal city in the 16th century. Then the Dutch spent 100 years enlarging the ramparts before the British added towers, a lighthouse and more gates. Perhaps the hats really come off to its current custodians, Sri Lanka’s Department of Archaeology, who’ve sensitively restored Galle while encouraging a community of artisanal boutiques, cafés and B&Bs. The modern city has now burst its walls, spreading along the coast and into the hills inland. Whether you are an artist, a poet, a photographer or something else; you will fall in love with Sri Lanka!

             The real live Unawatuna lies inside of Route A2 Galle - Matara main road. Unawatuna is located just 5 km south of Galle. The original village where it all started, Yaddehimulla, you turn off the main road just before 122 km Post. Just south of Galle, Unawatuna boasts sandy beaches, swimmable seas, and a backdrop of lush palm trees. Known as one of Sri Lanka's liveliest beach haunts, the town offers hints of backpacker vibes, plus an Instragrammable beach rope swing, shoreline bars, and a happy-hour-filled main drag. The motor-able, tarred road, a kilometre in length, brings you to the best area of Unawatuna with all the guest houses, homestays, restaurants, hotels, internet cafes, tuk-tuk stands, boutique hotels etc. There's two turnoffs - the turn off farther from the 122 km post leads to the far end of the beach with more hotel and restaurant options.

             The story of the Galle Dutch Fort; a UNESCO World Heritage Site reverberates through every traveller’s photos and captions. Initially built by the Portuguese in the 16th century during their conquests, the fort was later fortified and conquered by the Dutch in the 17th century, until it later fell to the might of the British. The old town of Galle was once used as a trading port for spices and other goods for over 200 years. However, today, the fort has been transformed into a place of history, romance and beauty where travellers are warmly welcomed to dive head first into the exotic stories and be a part of this heritage site.

             On the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, within the Bay of Galle, the Galle Fort sits as a major tourist attraction and UNESCO World Heritage Site. Built by the Portuguese in 1588 and then fortified by the Dutch in the 17th century, the Fort is a monument that has retained its appearance and cultural significance for over 400 years.  This was a place standing upon which the signals and warnings were made to the incoming ships. That is how it got the name ‘Flag Rock’. It is also the place where the Dutch hoisted their flag in 1733. A well picturesque site it is as the top of the rock offers spectacular views of the sea and the nearby bastions of the Fort, Meera Mosque and lighthouse. People especially throng here in the evenings to view the sunset on the sea. On its southernmost tip, Flag Rock is a bastion from which the Dutch would signal approaching ships with flags to warn them of the dangerous rocks ahead – hence the name
