             Badulla marks the southeast extremity of the Hill Country and is a transport gateway to the east coast. It is one of Sri Lanka’s oldest towns, and was occupied briefly by the Portuguese, who torched it upon leaving. The British also occupied the town and it became an important social center, but beyond the pretty gardens and clock tower, any vestiges of a past are lost in Badulla’s typical Sri Lankan bustle. The railway through the Hill Country from Colombo terminates here
