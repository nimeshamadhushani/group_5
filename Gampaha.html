             Gampaha is a tranquil place away from the humdrum of city life, thus it is a paradise for people who want to resort to a quaint place. It is situated northeast of Colombo, the capital. After Colombo, Negombo, Kalutara, Panadura and Avissawella it is the sixth-largest urban area in the Western Province. In Sinhala, the word “Gampaha” simply means Five Villages. Ihalagama, Pahalagama, Medagama, Pattiyagama and Aluthgama are classified as the five villages. Apparently, though, Pattiyagama village can not be established inside Gampaha’s city limits and remains contested. Also in the past Gampaha was known to be called Henarathgoda. Green verdant, blooming botanical gardens, and small temples define the town of Gampaha.

The park's location within the declared "Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte Bird Sanctuary" and highly urban built environment sets the stage for its paradigm importance. This 18-hectare territory is home to many aquatic birds and many other faunal species such as butterflies, dragonflies, and mammals native to Sri Lankan and Asian wetlands. Apart from that, this marsh area is a popular stopover of migratory birds.Beddegana wetland park is located amidst the heart of the Administrative capital Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte and minutes away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
