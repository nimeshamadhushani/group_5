             Colombo is a very busy city, with a historic past and a rich culture. It’s a bit chaotic at times and it’s full of crowds, tuk-tuks, shops, churches, restaurants, luxury hotels, shopping opportunities and interesting architecture.  The commercial capital of Sri Lanka, Colombo is also the largest city in the country. Colombo has a heady mix of modern life and a glorious past, all bustling with activity. It was once a sea port facilitating trade in Asia, and is now the entry point to the beautiful island nation of Sri Lanka. There are beautiful Sri Lankan colonial buildings everywhere you look, with Portuguese, Dutch and British influences, and modern structures as well.

            <p>
             Located next to Beira Lake, Gangaramaya Temple is a Buddhist temple and actually one of the oldest and most important temples of Colombo. The Gangaramaya Temple is strikingly beautiful, and it is also the most important place of worship for Buddhists in Sri Lanka. It is immaculately designed, with a hint of Chinese, Indian and Thai influence in its architecture. And it’s very beautiful as well, I must add, so it’s no wonder that it’s one of the most famous attractions in the city!

              Galle Face Green is a big urban park that offers half a kilometer of strolling along the water, more specifically along the coast of the Indian Ocean. A half-kilometre long stretch in Colombo that runs between the scenic Indian Ocean and the Galle Road, the Galle Face Green Promenade is not only an important landmark but also a favoured picnic spot amongst locals and tourists alike. It is considered to be “the largest open space in Colombo” and it’s definitely one of the must-see things in the city! Oh, and by the way, it’s a great choice for people traveling with their family and kids in Colombo as well.

             Sri Lanka gained independence from the British on the fourth of February 1948. The Independence Memorial Hall in Colombo was built to commemorate this turning point in Sri Lankan history. The Memorial Hall and Independence Square are best seen in the evening, when the fountains are lit up – it’s so nice!. Along with the Independence Memorial Museum, the monument is also home to a statue of the nation’s first Prime Minister Rt. Hon. Don Stephen Senanayake. Today, the revered hall stands as the venue for the most annual Independence Day celebrations & many religious events.

             This mosque located in the middle of the city is quite a sight in itself and also a big tourist attraction. It is said that the Red Mosque has been a landmark for sailors approaching the port of Colombo ever since it was built in 1908, and upon looking at it you can easily imagine that being true. The mosque’s distinct red-and-white pattern, whether swirling or spiraling or alternating, is quite mesmerizing. The domes are built in the shape of pomegranate, and the colorful brick patterns are meant to convey the same image.  Making its presence very evident with its unusually alternating white-and-rust colour scheme, this mosque is located at Second Cross Street in Pettah, and is also a popular landmark in the city.

             Ever heard of an island temple- Offering the perfect respite from the hustle and bustle of the city, Seema Malaka is one of the few places to visit in Colombo for couples which exudes tropical charm. rue to Bawa’s style, Seema Malakaya offers austere open spaces devoid of flashy festoons. The temple is built on three overwater platforms connected to each other and to the mainland by pontoon boardwalks. Bawa was inspired by the Anuradhapura and Ritigala forest monasteries of ancient Sri Lanka, which were similarly raised over bodies of water. The temple’s signature blue-tiled roof, made from collected spindles and banisters with wooden finishes, reflects the architecture of the Kandyan era, the last sovereign kingdom on the island. Designed by the renowned architect of Sri Lanka – Geoffrey Bawa, the Seema Malaka temple strikes a perfect balance between Indian, Chinese, Thai, and Sri Lankan architecture, that holds a greater significance in maintaining peace amongst all the cultures.
